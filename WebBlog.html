<h2 class="h2" id="high" >highlighting key milestones</h2>
<section class="Para">üßÆ The Chinese abacus from 3000 BC was one of the earliest devices used for counting and calculating, laying the groundwork for future computing technologies. <br> 
  ‚öôÔ∏è Blaise Pascal's invention of the Pascaline in 1642 marked a significant step towards mechanical computing, introducing the concept of a mechanical calculator. <br> 
  ü§ñ Gottfried Leibniz's work in the 1600s, including his calculating machine and foundational concepts in binary arithmetic, laid the groundwork for modern computer communication. <br>
  üî¢ Charles Babbage, known as the father of the computer, designed the mechanical calculating engines, the difference engine and the analytical engine, which were programmable and could store memory. <br>
  üë©‚Äçüíª Ada Lovelace is recognized as the world's first programmer, contributing algorithms and concepts fundamental to programming, such as data analysis and memory addressing. <br>
  üèóÔ∏è The 1900s saw the convergence of computing technologies, with Alan Turing proposing the Turing machine and Konrad Zuse inventing the world's first programmable computer. <br>
  üìä Herman Hollerith's census tabulator, an electromechanical machine, was a precursor to IBM and demonstrated the practical applications of computing in data processing. <br>
  üí° John von Neumann's contributions, including the stored-program concept and subroutines, were pivotal in shaping the architecture of modern computers. <br> 
  üì¶ The invention of the silicon transistor in 1947 and the subsequent development of the integrated circuit by Jack Kilby revolutionized computer hardware, making devices smaller, faster, and more efficient. <br> 
  üìà Gordon Moore's observation, known as Moore's Law, predicted the exponential growth in computing power, which has been a driving force in the industry's advancements.</section>

<h2 class="h2" id="inf">Influential figures</h2>
<section class="Para">‚ö™Blaise Pascal is credited with building the first mechanical adding machine, known as the Pascaline, in 1642. <br>
  ‚ö™Charles Babbage is considered the father of the computer. His notable designs include the difference engine and the analytical engine, the latter being a programmable mechanical computer.<br>
  ‚ö™The first silicon transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs.<br>
  ‚ö™Ada Lovelace is considered the world's first programmer. She worked closely with Babbage and created an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, outlining many fundamentals of programming.<br>
  ‚ö™Herman Hollerith designed one of the first successful electromechanical machines, the census tabulator, which read census data from punched cards. The success of this machine led him to found a firm that eventually became IBM.<br>
  ‚ö™Alan Turing's concept of a universal machine, later known as the Turing machine, was significant because it was capable of computing anything that is computable, laying the foundation for the modern computer. </section>

<h2 class="h2" id="imp" >Impact of computing on society</h2>
<img src="IMG/Impact.png" style= "max-width: 50%;
max-height: 50%;" class="section">
<section class="Para">‚ö™The first successful high-speed electronic digital computer was the ENIAC, completed in 1946. It was composed of nearly 18,000 vacuum tubes and could perform calculations at a much faster rate than its predecessors. <br>
  ‚ö™The integrated circuit, invented by Jack Kilby in 1958, allowed for many transistors to be packed onto a single chip, reducing the size, power consumption, and cost of computers, and sparking a hardware revolution. <br> 
  ‚ö™Moore's Law, attributed to Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, predicts that computing power would double every two years at a low cost, leading to smaller and more affordable computers.</section>
